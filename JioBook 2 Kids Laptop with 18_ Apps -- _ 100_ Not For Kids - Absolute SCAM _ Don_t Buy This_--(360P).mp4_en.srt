1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,700
Look at this.

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,440
What is this?

3
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,740
The icon in Tamil Nadu.

4
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,500
There is a

5
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,300
This must be a Ganesha's work.

6
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,080
Worked Paytm Payment

7
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,580
Dubai

8
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,720
Jalakala Jalakala Jalakala

9
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,640
Be Indian By Indian

10
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,860
There are many people like this.

11
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:12,700
It looks like a phone.

12
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,340
You are
making it difficult for the customers.

13
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:15,920
Why is it half closed?

14
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,040
Not laptop.

15
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,260
My face is jamming.

16
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,660
Hi Soldiers.

17
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,800
It looks
like a suitcase going to the village.

18
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,420
Bro bro bro

19
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,920
What bro?

20
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,480
You got the Jio book.

21
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:28,320
Tell me if it is good.

22
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:28,680
Tell me if it is good.

23
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,260
You have bought it yourself.

24
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,119
I know
that if I post a video about Jio book,

25
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:32,840
I will get views.

26
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:34,299
But,

27
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:34,840
For that,

28
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
If I get money for the rate of Jio book,

29
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:37,900
I won't get money.

30
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:39,540
But, that is not the main reason.

31
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,260
We have done a lot of Jio.

32
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,160
They have filed a case tomorrow.

33
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,900
We have to prove it.

34
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,600
As a customer, I will get views.

35
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,160
For that, this bill.

36
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,040
And this laptop.

37
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,040
Look at the bill.

38
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,020
Amazon bill.

39
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,240
So, I can ask questions now.

40
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,220
Because I am a customer.

41
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,440
Do you know what a customer is?

42
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:56,660
I don't know.

43
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:57,840
Have some respect.

44
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,060
So, this is the only thing.

45
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,380
Before this, there is Jio book 1.

46
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,380
This is Jio book 1.

47
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,680
This is Jio book 11.

48
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,200
After taking it, it was 11.

49
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:14,180
This Jio book 1 and Jio book 2.

50
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,220
For us, it is 2.

51
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,459
So, what is the difference between 2?

52
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,140
There is a difference in the box.

53
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:18,920
It is not the size.

54
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,540
What he did is nice.

55
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,180
Made in India in this place.

56
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,000
Made in China in this place.

57
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,940
Both are Chinese.

58
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,160
So, there is confusion.

59
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,560
What is the confusion?

60
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,460
Are you done?

61
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,240
Ok fine.

62
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,200
Now, let us open the box.

63
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,520
The bearded guy.

64
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,380
Uncle has posted a video.

65
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,080
He said that he has a beautiful laptop.

66
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,380
I think he has done this to help him.

67
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,340
He is the great master.

68
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,660
He has 20 million views.

69
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,480
Master is the best.

70
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,640
You are the only one in this area.

71
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,120
You are playing with others.

72
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,160
Jio book.

73
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:48,960
Look at the box.

74
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,300
They have given it in a recyclable cover.

75
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,240
Hey, I am here.

76
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,520
Where is the other laptop?

77
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,200
Give me the original laptop.

78
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,140
Look at the original laptop.

79
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,540
It looks like the old man's car.

80
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,300
Look at the laptop that is released now.

81
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,020
It is good.

82
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,780
If it was here, who would have done it?

83
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,000
I will take it to the shop.

84
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,260
Even the girl who
went to the king's court is catching me.

85
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,360
Let us see what else is in the box.

86
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,360
Look doctor.

87
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,160
Give me type C.

88
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,520
At least give me type B.

89
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,720
Poor guy.

90
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:12,360
Look, the same soldiers.

91
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:12,919
I thought.

92
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:13,820
You won't be there.

93
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,360
I think I will come back after 30 hours.

94
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,380
Ok.

95
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,060
Let us open the box.

96
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,340
Soldiers, this is the old one.

97
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,520
Keyboard is like this.

98
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,639
Key is being tracked.

99
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,180
The build quality is comparatively better.

100
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,560
The weight seems to be less.

101
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,419
Why is it less?

102
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,639
That is the reason.

103
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,979
Get started.

104
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,560
They have brought the keyboard edge to edge.

105
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,900
If they brought it here,

106
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,280
someone from China would have bought it.

107
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,240
Why did they bring it here?

108
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,479
Did they decide to give me a lesson?

109
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,560
There is no change in the OS.

110
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,780
It is the same OS.

111
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,740
Let us go with Chrome OS.

112
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,100
I think Chrome OS is open source.

113
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,640
Let us go with that.

114
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,260
What is this for?

115
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,640
Come here.

116
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,280
This is the store.

117
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,260
What is there in the store?

118
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,180
I think they have changed the store.

119
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:53,960
It is ok.

120
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,840
I will buy it for 14 rupees.

121
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,700
Why is it half closed?

122
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,960
You are dead.

123
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,340
He is not stuck with you.

124
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,820
You are stuck with him.

125
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,400
You are
manufacturing Mandarin Matrix in China.

126
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,120
I think a Chinese man has given you an app.

127
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,080
Welcome to Mandarin Matrix.

128
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:08,920
Chinese learning.

129
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,340
Your partner is Chinese learning.

130
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,800
Why should we learn Chinese?

131
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,200
Look here.

132
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,320
A Rambur company
is selling books for Chinese learning.

133
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,380
They are selling books for us.

134
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,920
I think
I will learn Hindi if I believe in them.

135
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,780
Why should they learn Chinese?

136
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,860
We can't
say anything if we use these software.

137
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,980
We can't accept what we say now.

138
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,220
We have to sudden it.

139
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,180
What is there inside?

140
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,620
What is there inside?

141
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,700
I want to see that.

142
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,660
What are we going to do now?

143
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,780
We are going to see what is there inside.

144
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,100
But before that, we need to see something.

145
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,800
This video is sponsored.

146
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,060
I have come.

147
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,860
CDKeyoffer.com

148
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,960
CDKeyoffer
is a digital product key selling site.

149
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,600
Windows 10
Pro OM and MS office keys are very cheap.

150
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,780
If you use our promo code A2D,
you will get 30% off.

151
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,320
Don't forget to use the code.

152
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,440
Open it.

153
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,980
Okay.

154
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,460
It's open.

155
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,480
I think Renji has a screw in this.

156
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,940
Yes, soldiers.

157
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,100
He has a screw in this.

158
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,240
Look here.

159
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,500
What are you planning?

160
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,260
Thank you.

161
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,640
That's my product.

162
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,060
Soldiers,
last time we didn't have any cover sheet.

163
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:25,760
Look at this time.

164
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,720
They have kept it to spread heat.

165
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,720
This is for Jeeva.

166
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,339
Again, that China number is nice.

167
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,320
How the...

168
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,480
Okay, what kind of battery is this?

169
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,860
What kind of battery is this?

170
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,820
What is this?

171
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,640
We can't even do sales.

172
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,700
What is this?

173
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,160
Battery.

174
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,580
This?

175
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,440
This won't work.

176
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,480
Let it be.

177
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,720
Let's open the original Jeeva book.

178
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,320
Oh, they have given a cover sheet in this.

179
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:51,560
They didn't give any infinix.

180
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,880
Last time we didn't have any cover sheet.

181
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,260
Sorry, I thought it was infinix.

182
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,520
It's okay, brother.

183
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:58,399
Okay, fine.

184
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,120
Both of them are...

185
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,700
It's like a chicken.

186
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,580
Let's see what's the difference.

187
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,240
This is Jeeva Book 1.

188
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:06,279
This is Jeeva Book 2.

189
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,980
The first thing is the battery.

190
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,640
The battery is 5000 mAh.

191
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,640
In this case, it's only 4000 mAh.

192
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,839
They reduced it to 1500 mAh.

193
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:13,600
That's why they reduced the weight.

194
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,459
Because the mAh has been reduced.

195
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,880
There is a battery connector here.

196
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,600
We have to remove the battery.

197
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,180
We have to do that all the time.

198
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,100
We have to do it here.

199
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,980
Battery.

200
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,779
Kit Kat printer.

201
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,140
Shenzhen utility.

202
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:29,920
Energy.

203
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,460
This is the manufacturer.

204
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,100
This is Jeeva Book 1's battery.

205
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,640
It has a noise.

206
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,840
Don't talk in a bad way.

207
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,300
Okay, soldiers.

208
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,600
Now remove...

209
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,080
Motherboard.

210
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,460
Jeeva Book 1's neural schema.

211
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,260
That's the motherboard.

212
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,780
Soldiers.

213
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,240
This is the neural schema.

214
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,360
This is the neural schema.

215
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,420
I have removed the brain separately.

216
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,280
One is Jeeva New.

217
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,280
This is Jeeva Old.

218
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:56,780
It looks like a phone.

219
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,600
Who is talking?

220
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,520
Ganesha.

221
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,360
Who is talking?

222
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,020
Who is talking?

223
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,420
Okay, soldiers.

224
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,560
This is Jeeva Book 2's motherboard.

225
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,240
Do you have this?

226
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,940
This is the media tech.

227
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,680
8788B.

228
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,740
And this is Micron's 4GP RAM.

229
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,400
I think it is LPDDR4.

230
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,360
This is Kingston's memory 600GP.

231
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,340
It is not memory.

232
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:17,820
It is EMMC.

233
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,440
EMMC.

234
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,040
600GP.

235
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,460
Do you see it?

236
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:19,880
I have put it there.

237
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,300
And this side...

238
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,000
This is Jeeva Book 1.

239
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,580
There will be two chips in this.

240
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,600
Because...

241
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,440
This is Qualcomm's Snapdragon 665.

242
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,260
And this is Samsung's memory plus NAND.

243
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:32,900
EMMC.

244
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,760
Not NAND.

245
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,420
EMMC.

246
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,500
So both are together.

247
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,200
Okay, soldiers.

248
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,180
And I found another important thing.

249
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,260
So this looks like USB 3.0.

250
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,880
But actually...

251
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,580
It is connected with 4 pins.

252
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:45,920
Do you see it?

253
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,360
This is actually USB 2.0.

254
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,040
Similarly, if you look at this...

255
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,620
It looks like 3.0.

256
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,720
But if you look at the back...

257
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,340
It is 2.0.

258
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,620
This is cheating.

259
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,960
Hey, what is this crap?

260
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
Okay, soldiers.

261
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,520
Both are separated.

262
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,580
Now I will add one and see how it is.

263
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,820
And see if there is any improvement.

264
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,800
Two weeks later.

265
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,420
Soldiers.

266
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,900
This is the usage date.

267
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,080
There are many important videos.

268
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,140
That is, why did they release Jeeva Book?

269
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:10,720
Look at this.

270
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,420
Actually, what is Jeeva Book for?

271
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,180
Learning Book.

272
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,880
For small children.

273
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,940
For small children.

274
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,680
If you come to Corona lockdown...

275
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,420
We have to shut down our home.

276
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,980
That's why this is there.

277
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,880
And then...

278
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,860
In the ad...

279
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,080
A cook is doing this.

280
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,620
You
can watch the video on YouTube and learn.

281
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,620
To learn.

282
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,740
Who will learn?

283
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,640
Kids will learn.

284
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,440
They go to school.

285
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:33,660
They will learn.

286
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,460
They have laptops.

287
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,300
But the problem is...

288
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:37,980
This is an app store.

289
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,440
That is, Jeeva Store name.

290
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,280
There are three categories,
features and additional apps.

291
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,760
If you go to the additional apps...

292
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,680
There are many apps.

293
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,060
Good thing, right?

294
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,620
Good thing.

295
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,200
But there is a problem in it.

296
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,920
First thing is banned apps.

297
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,420
Look at that.

298
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,600
By the Indian government...

299
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,560
That is, by the central government...

300
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,120
All banned Chinese apps are in this.

301
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,060
Hey, you fool.

302
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,540
The first app is TikTok.

303
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,780
Tiktok banned app.

304
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,820
But it is in this.

305
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,800
TikTok music videos and live.

306
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,560
TikTok works.

307
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,500
What is this?

308
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,720
What is this?

309
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,100
TikTok
is still being used by some community.

310
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,620
You think
you are buying a Jeeva book and using it.

311
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,180
I have a doubt on you.

312
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,100
Are you listening to me?

313
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,320
Why are you speaking in Tamil?

314
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,080
This is a food for soldiers.

315
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,900
Why is he tracking me?

316
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,740
Hey, come.

317
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,400
I am coming.

318
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,180
Food for soldiers?

319
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,020
If you want soldiers,
put it in the comments.

320
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,260
Tell me if you want.

321
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,540
Did you see, soldiers?

322
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,419
The government banned Chinese apps.

323
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,460
Jeeva book is the cheapest Indian laptop.

324
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,179
Did you poke your face?

325
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,919
If you are
worried about the ban of TikTok videos...

326
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,000
Buy this Jeeva book.

327
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,559
I have the second one.

328
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,840
If you want, you can ping me.

329
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,240
If you ask me about this...

330
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,740
There is an app called X.

331
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,360
You know it and it is called Twitter.

332
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,240
But if you buy it below...

333
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,880
Look at this.

334
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:56,600
What is this?

335
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,600
If I had seen this, I would have blurred it.

336
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,280
There will only be a hub.

337
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,260
You can find the rest.

338
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,840
Bro, the ban is in India.

339
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,660
It doesn't work like that.

340
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,559
Look above that.

341
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,860
Tarubo VPN.

342
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,540
I have given it nearby.

343
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,000
Look here, soldiers.

344
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,000
I have installed it.

345
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,740
It is coming.

346
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,780
It is so bad.

347
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,380
It is
coming differently than what I thought.

348
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,440
What is this?

349
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,840
If you see someone inside, he is removing
the dowsers and is standing like a god.

350
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,020
If you ask me if this is the only thing...

351
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,840
What is there?

352
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,660
Look here.

353
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,559
X videos, movie, P***.

354
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,620
Hardcore P*** videos are free.

355
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,679
What is free?

356
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,340
Look here.

357
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,320
Tamil is bad.

358
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,500
The verb for Maache LOL.

359
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,900
I can only see ads in Telangana as we're
selling the icon are used for children.

360
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,020
Even the icon in appears
on many wee ingredients names as well.

361
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,960
You'll sink your tongue.

362
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:36,580
Look here soldiers.

363
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,000
Mixed Text reading ad...

364
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,580
Yeah, I bought this tissue & sipped my tea.

365
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,040
Look at the different of this area.

366
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,080
This isn't world.

367
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,840
One dot, two dots, three dots.

368
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,780
Its a styled защet spot.

369
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,100
Holy shit.

370
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,299
sh Jesse Lockwood is annoying.

371
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:59,340
This is what the Jio gave.

372
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:01,480
So we give cutting and cutting?

373
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,580
Do you know how bad this is?

374
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,380
Look here, there's a chandelier.

375
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,400
Erection problem.

376
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,600
Hey Tommy, get up.

377
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,559
Soldiers, this is not only for age landing.

378
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,700
It's not normal landing.

379
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,740
There's a doctor at 11 in the night.

380
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,700
They've advertised this as wrong.

381
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,799
Not for kids.

382
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,140
Only for...

383
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:21,900
Okay fine.

384
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,720
This is bad.

385
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:23,940
What is this?

386
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:25,360
This is the map in the Jio book.

387
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,440
So if you ask if it's not in Jio book 1.

388
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,380
They released it.

389
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,880
They've put it in a box.

390
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:31,700
There's no software update for this.

391
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:34,080
The Jio OS in this is 0.1.

392
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,559
The one in this is 1.0.

393
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,220
You killed me.

394
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,780
Red chip, blue color laptop.

395
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,559
This is a serious problem.

396
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,360
Why I'm saying this.

397
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,500
We won't buy this.

398
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:45,820
Why?

399
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,500
Because
most of the people who watch our videos.

400
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,660
They don't buy it.

401
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,000
But they watch TV.

402
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,260
They have a chance to buy this.

403
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,120
Whatever it may be.

404
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,560
The sales may be low.

405
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,620
But it's not like that in North.

406
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,180
They've bought it with their money.

407
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:02,980
For example.

408
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,380
Our uncle.

409
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,040
He posted
a video saying this laptop is not good.

410
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,400
But now.

411
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
He posted
a video saying this laptop is super.

412
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,740
Another thing is.

413
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,520
It works with Ctrl C and Ctrl V.

414
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,860
It's an additional feature.

415
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,920
If you connect your phone to USB or OTG.

416
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,960
It works with Ctrl V and Ctrl C.

417
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:21,880
It's a basic thing.

418
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,860
It's an additional feature.

419
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,820
He's also saying this.

420
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,960
He has also posted this.

421
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,040
Worst behavior.

422
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:26,860
So even on days like this.

423
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,180
Not only that.

424
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,460
People there.

425
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,380
If you say that it's an Indian made product.

426
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,340
Many people have the
mindset to buy it with their eyes closed.

427
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:36,640
For example.

428
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,900
Lenovo took me to Delhi for an event.

429
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,180
They have launched
the workstation and servers there.

430
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,020
Everyone who came there asked questions.

431
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,580
I also asked questions to that person.

432
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,400
You must have seen the video.

433
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,260
IPM is there.

434
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,680
But there is a guy from the north.

435
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,540
He asked me.

436
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,240
They banned the import of laptops.

437
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,740
You manufacture it in India.

438
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,480
Where do you manufacture it?

439
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:58,960
He said.

440
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,200
It's not wrong to ask this.

441
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,520
But it's wrong to ask anyone.

442
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,440
Because Lenovo is a Chinese company.

443
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,240
A Chinese company
is running an event in a hotel room.

444
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,360
When asked to manufacture it in India.

445
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,780
What will he do?

446
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,520
Not like that.

447
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,460
Like this.

448
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:11,780
He said.

449
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,740
He managed and sent it.

450
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,860
The reason I'm saying this.

451
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,420
See how much they are involved in it.

452
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,720
They are like that.

453
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,640
They will definitely buy it.

454
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,720
In the north.

455
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,800
The people support the idea of Indian-made.

456
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,360
They think
it's our basic duty to support them.

457
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,020
For example.

458
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:32,900
You have two pills.

459
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,760
Red pill and blue pill.

460
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,900
Red pill is Chinese-made.

461
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,980
Even if the Chinese-made is better.

462
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,160
Even if it is cheap.

463
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:39,820
They will buy the blue pill.

464
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:40,660
Indian-made.

465
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,360
There are
many people who say be Indian by Indian.

466
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,300
You are anti-India.

467
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,800
Their target ends there.

468
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,700
There is no need to come here.

469
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,680
There is a matter.

470
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,660
Their village doesn't have a mother laptop.

471
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,580
That's why it exists.

472
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,960
Only if you use your mother's laptop.

473
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,100
You will know.

474
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,020
There is no such laptop.

475
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,860
Since there is no mother laptop.

476
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,960
Everyone is saying this is okay.

477
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,600
But if you give your mother's laptop.

478
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,620
It will be great.

479
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,660
At least change the name.

480
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,320
It will be good if you give it.

481
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:04,960
In this.

482
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,980
There is no Google play service.

483
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:07,920
They use their own.

484
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,060
We know that Android is open source.

485
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,260
We have said in the previous video.

486
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,120
But Android's play services are open source.

487
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:15,980
There is no Android play service.

488
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,920
There is Google play service.

489
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,620
There is Google play.

490
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,280
It is not free.

491
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,460
Why should we give money?

492
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,700
We have bare Android.

493
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,540
We can use it.

494
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,700
They did this.

495
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,780
Not only that.

496
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,280
We developed apps for that.

497
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,280
We went to the app developers.

498
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,780
They brought our app to the app store.

499
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,340
Instead of that.

500
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,380
They have already.

501
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,900
There is an app on online.

502
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,540
There is a website.

503
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,060
They tie up with that.

504
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,180
They integrated inside.

505
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:38,820
The problem with integrating.

506
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,820
They have a Gilme app.

507
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,240
They have added that app.

508
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,620
The problem with whom?

509
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,420
Only with Jio.

510
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,320
Jio should have filtered this.

511
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,200
Instead of filtering.

512
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,420
It is not a good thing.

513
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,800
Look at the top.

514
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,160
Disclaimer.

515
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,340
The additional
apps are not hosted on Jio store.

516
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,920
And it is being
made available through that party store.

517
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,900
Jio doesn't take any
responsibility or liability for the app.

518
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,980
He will bomb it.

519
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
He will take it.

520
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:02,820
It is like that.

521
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,940
Who is the one who puts that party inside?

522
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,880
Jio only.

523
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,600
Because we download it in Jio store.

524
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,740
Sometimes they take responsibility.

525
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,040
Others don't take responsibility.

526
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,980
I can't take responsibility for this.

527
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,600
Because that party.

528
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,420
Who is that party?

529
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,000
They didn't put their name.

530
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,660
Who should I ask?

531
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,600
Jio should be asked.

532
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,480
Because the product is Jio.

533
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,380
The software is Jio.

534
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,740
The shop is also Jio.

535
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,700
Jio is being kept in the digital store.

536
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,400
Even the Sim is Jio.

537
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,280
So when all are Jio.

538
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,060
If the store is that party.

539
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,460
If the app is that party.

540
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,360
They won't accept it.

541
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,920
So Jio should take responsibility for this.

542
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,800
And remove all this.

543
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,160
If Jio takes responsibility.

544
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,000
The laptop should also be destroyed.

545
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:34,620
I am telling the truth.

546
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,460
It is not available in search.

547
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,820
It will come when you scroll.

548
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,680
I will show you when I scroll.

549
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,220
It will come when you scroll.

550
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
It will open when you click.

551
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,040
So it is not a good thing.

552
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,420
Outside only.

553
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,640
School, student, etc.

554
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,700
But there is no problem with that.

555
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,260
Look here.

556
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,480
Ashing include standard io.h.

557
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,740
stdio.h.

558
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,800
After that there is no space.

559
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:21,680
There is nothing.

560
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,280
Look at the int main.

561
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,020
If you give like this.

562
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,820
It will be syntax error.

563
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,500
If you put this.

564
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:25,840
It will be error.

565
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,400
Editor.

566
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,800
Put it in the online company and show.

567
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:39,220
Does it error?

568
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,200
So in the ad.

569
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,640
They are showing you with small boys.

570
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,260
But this is an app for small boys.

571
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,520
No.

572
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:44,620
It is not.

573
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,200
It is a good thing.

574
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,280
None of our Tamil creators.

575
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,560
Sponsored this video.

576
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,600
That is great.

577
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,000
Because I think it will work.

578
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,060
The problem for us is.

579
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,520
If we do in Tamil.

580
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,640
Our videos will not be seen in North.

581
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,680
That is why.

582
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,600
I think
it is better if we put Hindi subtitles.

583
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,060
Look at the audience.

584
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,520
First put English subtitles.

585
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:03,740
Soldiers.

586
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,200
It is difficult to put English subtitles.

587
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,040
No one is coming.

588
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:07,980
If you know.

589
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,440
Tell me anything.

590
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,320
It is said to be done at a low price.

591
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,880
They ask for a lot of money.

592
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,040
Because they
ask for 1000 to 200 rupees for a video.

593
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:13,920
It is very difficult.

594
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:14,600
Content.

595
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:14,700
If you want to come to the content.

596
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,500
Put it in the A2D Media Group.

597
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,240
If you want to edit the subtitles.

598
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,560
You can join here.

599
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,200
Okay soldiers.

600
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:20,760
This is it.

601
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,640
Those who have seen this video.

602
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,020
There are many things.

603
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,960
Like internal or hardware.

604
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,700
There are many things.

605
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,440
But.

606
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,060
There is nothing to talk about.

607
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,700
Let's say it simply.

608
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,300
Simply yes.

609
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:29,980
No need to buy.

610
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,520
You don't have to buy.

611
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,280
After watching the old video.

612
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,760
You know why I bought it.

613
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,800
Because this is.

614
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,540
Laptop bill.

615
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,660
My moon is jamming.

616
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,060
I will show you that I have a bill.

617
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,220
That is why.

618
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,020
That is why I bought it.

619
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,900
You don't think wrong.

620
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,300
Why?

621
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:44,580
Money.

622
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,440
You are wasting money.

623
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,940
This is my moon jamming.

624
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,260
Take care.

625
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:49,760
That is why.

626
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,380
I am a customer.

627
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,280
I should not trouble the customer.

628
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,060
Okay.

629
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,380
So.

630
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,220
Next.

631
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:54,840
Make a good product from the next product.

632
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,580
I will give a good review.

633
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,200
Okay.

634
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:57,580
Fine.

635
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,220
Okay soldiers.

636
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:58,920
I will see you in the next video.

637
00:16:59,480 --> 00:16:59,640
Before that.

638
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,140
Follow me.

639
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,660
Follow me.

640
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,460
Instagram is there.

641
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,360
If you have cheated like this.

642
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,480
Put it in the comment section below.

643
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:05,859
Your opinion is right.

644
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,480
Put it in the comments.

645
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,380
And most importantly.

646
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:07,960
Share it with others.

647
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,380
Because only then.

648
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,540
You will get more awareness.

649
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,119
And more digital products.

650
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,000
They call it digital literacy.

651
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:14,960
In our country.

652
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:15,880
There is a new word.

653
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:16,720
I will add that word.

654
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,180
Add the word digital literacy.

655
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,820
Add the word digital literacy.

656
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,020
That is when.

657
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,220
Digital literacy will grow.

658
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,280
This awareness will grow.

659
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:23,839
Okay.

660
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,380
Bye.

661
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:39,680
Bye.
